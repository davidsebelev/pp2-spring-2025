#you can write var like that and its ok
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
#And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:
x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

#so we can make tuple for example and then vars 
fruits = ["apple","banana","cherry"]
x,y,z = fruits
#so now all all vars will be apple banaba and cherry
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
